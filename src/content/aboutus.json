        "paragraph": "We built OpenObserve on a simple truth - the best tech grows in the open. Our open source foundation isn't just a checkbox; it's our lifeblood.<br><br>When observability tools hide their inner workings, everyone loses. That's why we've thrown open our codebase, letting you peek under the hood, tinker with the engine, or rebuild entire systems to fit your world.<br><br>Our community keeps us honest. Developers from Boston to Bangalore contribute code that solves real problems they've faced firsthand. This diversity of thought has taken us places we never would have discovered alone.<br><br>We're pragmatists about sustainability too. While our core platform remains free for all, our enterprise offerings fund the coffee that fuels our late-night coding sessions. This balance ensures OpenObserve stays both accessible and evolving."

This distributed DNA shapes everything we build: resilient, global, and uncompromising.",
