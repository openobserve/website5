            "question": "How does OpenObserve collect traces?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve collects distributed traces through OpenTelemetry instrumentation. The platform accepts traces via the OTLP protocol, supporting both manual and automatic instrumentation methods. For services already instrumented with OpenTelemetry, you can configure the exporter to send traces directly to OpenObserve. The system maintains trace context across service boundaries using W3C trace context standards."
          },
          {
            "question": " What information is captured in traces?",
            "answer": "Each trace consists of spans representing operations across services. Spans include essential information such as operation name, timestamp, duration, and service name. Additional context is captured through span attributes, events, and links. The system preserves parent-child relationships between spans, enabling full request path visualization. Error information and stack traces are automatically captured for failed operations."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does trace analysis work?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve processes traces to provide multiple analysis perspectives. The trace view shows the complete request timeline with nested spans and timing information. Service maps are generated automatically from trace data, showing dependencies and interaction patterns. The query engine supports filtering traces by service, operation, duration, and custom attributes. You can analyze latency distributions and error rates across services."
          },
          {
            "question": "What visualization capabilities are available?",
            "answer": "The platform provides several visualization options for trace data. The trace timeline view shows the hierarchical relationship between spans with precise timing. Service maps display the topology of your distributed system based on actual request flows. The dashboard system supports custom visualizations for trace metrics, including latency histograms and error rate trends."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does OpenObserve handle trace sampling?",
            "answer": "Trace sampling is configurable to balance data volume with observability needs. The system supports head-based sampling at collection time and tail-based sampling for more sophisticated scenarios. You can define sampling rules based on service names, operation types, or custom attributes. The platform maintains statistical accuracy while reducing storage requirements through intelligent sampling strategies."
          },
          {
            "question": "What query capabilities are available for traces?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve implements a powerful query engine for trace analysis. You can search traces using service names, operation names, duration thresholds, and custom attributes. The system supports complex queries combining multiple criteria with logical operators. Trace queries can be saved and reused across dashboards. The query language allows for aggregations and statistical analysis of trace data."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does service dependency analysis work?",
            "answer": "The platform automatically generates service dependency information from trace data. Service maps show both direct and indirect dependencies between components. The system calculates key metrics like request rates, error rates, and latency percentiles for each service interaction. You can analyze dependency changes over time and identify critical paths in your architecture."
          },
          {
            "question": "What retention and storage options are available?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve optimizes trace storage using columnar format and efficient compression. Retention periods are configurable per data source, allowing you to balance storage costs with analysis needs. The system supports tiered storage for different trace retention requirements. Historical traces can be accessed efficiently through the query interface while maintaining quick access to recent data."

          {
            "question": "What types of pipelines does OpenObserve support?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve supports two main types of pipelines: real-time and scheduled. Real-time pipelines process data as it arrives, transforming and enriching it on the fly. These pipelines can include multiple processing steps using functions, conditions, and stream operations. Scheduled pipelines run at defined intervals, allowing for batch processing and periodic data transformations."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do functions work in pipelines?",
            "answer": "Functions in OpenObserve use Vector Remap Language (VRL) for data transformation. Each function contains VRL code that can parse, transform, and enrich data. Functions can access the incoming data fields, perform conditional processing, and modify or create new fields. For example, a function might parse JSON logs, extract specific fields, and enrich them with geographical information using enrichment tables."
          },
          {
            "question": "What are enrichment tables and how are they used?",
            "answer": "Enrichment tables are CSV-based lookup tables that allow you to add additional context to your data. You can upload CSV files containing reference data, which can then be queried within pipeline functions using the get_enrichment_table_record function. Common use cases include IP to location mapping, user agent parsing, and adding business context to technical data."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does data parsing work in pipelines?",
            "answer": "Data parsing in OpenObserve pipelines is handled through VRL functions. The platform supports parsing various formats including JSON, structured logs, and custom formats. Functions can include conditional logic to apply different parsing rules based on the data source or content. Error handling is built into the parsing functions, allowing graceful handling of malformed data."
          },
          {
            "question": "What stream operations are available?",
            "answer": "Pipeline streams can be configured with various operations including source selection, transformation steps, and destination routing. The platform supports both logs and metrics streams. You can create complex workflows with multiple processing steps, conditions, and parallel processing paths. Stream operations maintain data consistency while allowing for flexible transformation chains."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do pipeline conditions work?",
            "answer": "Conditions in pipelines allow for selective processing based on data attributes. Using VRL expressions, you can create sophisticated routing and processing logic. Conditions can check field values, apply pattern matching, and implement complex business rules. This enables targeted processing of specific data streams or message types."
          },
          {
            "question": "What monitoring and debugging features are available?",
            "answer": "The platform provides visibility into pipeline execution through the pipeline viewer. You can monitor pipeline performance, track processing errors, and debug transformation logic. The system maintains metrics about pipeline throughput and processing latency. Test functions allow you to verify transformation logic before deployment."
          },
          {
            "question": "How are pipeline changes managed?",
            "answer": "Pipeline configurations are managed through the OpenObserve interface, where you can create, edit, and delete pipelines. Changes to pipeline functions can be tested before deployment using sample data. The platform maintains version control for pipeline configurations, allowing you to track changes and roll back if needed."

            "question": "What types of alerts does OpenObserve support?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve provides two main alert types: Standard and Real-time. Standard alerts run at scheduled intervals, evaluating conditions against your data. Real-time alerts continuously monitor data streams for immediate detection. Both types support SQL queries and quick condition builders for alert definition."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do alert conditions work?",
            "answer": "Alert conditions can be created using either SQL queries or the quick condition builder. The quick builder allows you to select columns, operators, and values with an AND operator for multiple conditions. SQL mode provides full query flexibility for complex alert scenarios. Conditions can include aggregations with configurable thresholds and evaluation periods."
          },
          {
            "question": "What notification options are available?",
            "answer": "The platform supports multiple notification destinations that can be configured for each alert. Notifications include customizable templates for alert messages. You can set silence periods to prevent notification fatigue, specifying durations during which repeat notifications are suppressed. Each destination can be configured independently."
          },
          {
            "question": "How are alert thresholds configured?",
            "answer": "Thresholds in OpenObserve alerts include both occurrence counts and time windows. You can specify how many times a condition must be met within a period to trigger an alert. The system supports comparison operators (=, >, <, etc.) for threshold definition. Aggregation windows can be configured to evaluate data over specific time periods."
          },
          {
            "question": "What alert scheduling options exist?",
            "answer": "For standard alerts, you can configure:<br/> Evaluation frequency (how often the alert condition is checked) <br/> Evaluation period (the time window for data analysis) <br/>Threshold occurrences (how many times a condition must be met)<br/>Silence periods (duration to suppress repeat notifications)"
          },
          {
            "question": "How does real-time alerting work?",
            "answer": "Real-time alerts continuously monitor incoming data streams. They evaluate conditions as data arrives, providing immediate notification when conditions are met. Real-time alerts support the same condition-building and notification options as standard alerts, but with continuous evaluation instead of scheduled checks."
          },
          {
            "question": "What alert management features are available?",
            "answer": "The platform provides a comprehensive alert management interface where you can: <br/> 1.Create and edit alert definitions<br/> 2.Configure notification destinations<br/> 3.Set up alert conditions and thresholds<br/> 4.Define evaluation periods and frequencies<br/> 5.Monitor alert status and history <br/> 6.Configure silence periods<br/> 7.Add custom variables for alert context"
