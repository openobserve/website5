            "question": "Does OpenObserve offer a free tier?",
            "answer": "Yes, OpenObserve offers a free tier that includes a limited amount of log storage and ingestion. It's ideal for small projects, testing, or evaluation purposes. Usage beyond the free tier will require a paid plan."
          },
          {
            "question": "What are the available pricing plans?",
            "answer": "OpenObserve offers flexible pricing plans:<br><ul><li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Basic features with limited storage and ingestion rate.</li><li><strong>Standard:</strong> Includes higher retention, alerts, and dashboard features.</li><li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Advanced analytics, extended retention, custom integrations, and premium support.</li></ul>"
          },
          {
            "question": "How is pricing calculated?",
            "answer": "Pricing is typically based on data ingestion volume (e.g., GB/day), retention period, and feature set. Some plans may include limits on dashboard usage, queries, or team members."
          },
          {
            "question": "What happens when I exceed the limits of my plan?",
            "answer": "If you exceed your planâ€™s ingestion or storage limits, overage charges may apply, or your data ingestion may be throttled. You can upgrade your plan at any time to avoid service disruption."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a trial available for premium features?",
            "answer": "Yes, OpenObserve provides a free trial of premium features so users can evaluate the platform before committing to a paid plan. You can enable the trial from your dashboard."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I change my plan later?",
            "answer": "Yes, plans are flexible. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time through the billing settings in your account."
          },
          {
            "question": "Does OpenObserve offer usage-based billing?",
            "answer": "Yes, OpenObserve supports usage-based billing, which means you only pay for the data you ingest and store. This helps optimize cost for varying workloads."
